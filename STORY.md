## Story Brief

**Title:** Alexander — The Great
**Category:** History
**Estimated read:** 5 minutes
**Target audience:** Anyone who doom-scrolls. No prior history knowledge assumed.
**Emotional arc:** Inspired → Curious → Awed → Melancholic → Moved

**The angle:** Full arc. Birth to death in 5 scenes. Not a history lesson — a character study of ambition, genius, and the cost of greatness.

**Tone:** Cinematic documentary narrator. Poetic but never pretentious. Short punchy sentences mixed with longer ones. Second person occasionally ("you just read his story"). Make the reader feel something, not just learn something.

**What makes someone keep scrolling:** The feeling that the next line will hit harder than the last.

## Scene 1 — The Boy & The Horse

**Scene number:** 01 / 05
**Background palette:** Warm amber, ochre, Macedonian dusk. Suggestion of golden light.
**Emotional tone:** Wonder. The first sign of something extraordinary.

**Headline (word-by-word reveal):**
He was 13 years old when he tamed a horse no one else could touch.

**Body:**
The horse was called Bucephalus. Every rider had failed — it reared, threw them, refused. Alexander watched quietly. Then he noticed: the horse was terrified of its own shadow. He turned it toward the sun, mounted it, and rode. His father Philip watched and wept. "My son," he said, "find a kingdom worthy of you. Macedonia is too small."

**Pullquote (gold, italic):**
Some people are told their whole lives that they're ordinary. Alexander was told the opposite — and he believed it completely.

## Scene 2 — The Crossing

**Scene number:** 02 / 05
**Background palette:** Cold deep blue. Pre-dawn sea light. The Hellespont at first light.
**Emotional tone:** Audacity. The moment everything changed.

**Headline (word-by-word reveal):**
At 20, he inherited a kingdom. At 22, he decided to conquer the world.

**Body:**
His father Philip was assassinated at a wedding. Alexander took the throne in a single night — executing rivals, silencing doubters, consolidating power before dawn. Two years later, he stood at the Hellespont, the narrow strait separating Europe from Asia. He threw his spear into the Persian shore. That was his declaration of war. Not a letter. Not a messenger. A spear.

**Pullquote (gold, italic):**
The greatest moves in history rarely look strategic in the moment. They look like arrogance.

## Scene 3 — The Undefeated

**Scene number:** 03 / 05
**Background palette:** Dark red, bronze, smoke. The chaos of ancient battle.
**Emotional tone:** Awe. The scale of what he achieved becomes real.

**Headline (word-by-word reveal):**
He fought for 11 years. He never lost a single battle.

**Special element — Battle names:**
Display these as a separate text block between headline and body.
Font: Cormorant Garamond, 22px, italic, gold (#c9a84c).
Each name on its own line. They should feel like a list of scars.

  Granicus.
  Issus.
  Gaugamela.
  Tyre.
  The Hydaspes.

**Body:**
He defeated the Persian Empire — the largest empire the world had ever seen — in three years. He fought at the front of every battle, not from a safe distance. He knew his soldiers by name. When Bucephalus died in battle in India, he named a city after him.

**Pullquote (gold, italic):**
He didn't inspire loyalty through power. He inspired it through presence.

## Scene 4 — The Edge of the World

**Scene number:** 04 / 05
**Background palette:** Dark teal, deep green, river mist. The edge of the known world.
**Emotional tone:** Melancholy. The first crack in the legend.

**Headline (word-by-word reveal):**
He reached India and wept — because there was nowhere left to go.

**Body:**
At the Hyphasis River, his army stopped. They had been marching for eight years. They were exhausted, homesick, and done. For the first time, Alexander's men refused to follow. He locked himself in his tent for three days, hoping they would change their minds. They didn't. He turned back. It was the only retreat of his life.

**Pullquote (gold, italic):**
What do you do when you've achieved everything you ever wanted, and it's still not enough?

## Scene 5 — 32 Years Old

**Scene number:** 05 / 05
**Background palette:** Deep purple, dark burgundy, candlelight. Babylon at night.
**Emotional tone:** Loss. Grief. Then something like transcendence.

**Headline (word-by-word reveal):**
He died in Babylon in 323 BC. He was 32.

**Special element — Isolated line:**
Immediately after the headline, before the body, display this as a standalone line.
Font: Inter, 18px, italic, weight 300. Text secondary colour. Give it breathing room above and below (20px gap).

  Younger than most people reading this.

**Body:**
He had spent 11 years conquering the known world. He had founded over 70 cities. He died of a fever — or possibly poison — in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar. When asked on his deathbed who should inherit his empire, he said: "The strongest." His generals tore it apart within a generation.

**Pullquote (gold, italic):**
He spent his life building something no one could hold after him. But 2,300 years later, you just read his story. Some things outlast empires.

**Divider:** thin gold line, 60px wide

**Card title:** CARRY THIS WITH YOU

**Card body:**
Alexander spread Greek culture so far that Greek became the common language of the ancient world for 300 years. The New Testament was written in Greek because of him. Every time you say "philosophy," "democracy," or "cosmos" — you're speaking a language he carried on horseback to the edge of the known world.

## Tone Reference — Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Short sentences for impact: "Not a letter. Not a messenger. A spear."
- Use second person sparingly for gut-punch moments: "Younger than most people reading this."
- Let facts do the emotional work — don't over-explain
- End scenes on a question or a reframe, not a summary
- Vary sentence length — mix 3-word sentences with longer flowing ones

**Don't:**
- Use academic language ("Alexander's military campaigns were notable for...")
- Over-explain historical context
- Use adjectives that tell the reader how to feel ("amazingly," "incredibly")
- End on a fact — end on a feeling
- Use more than 3 sentences in the body that start with "He"
